Create a Gendo subroutine called refine_answer that takes two string 
parameters, candidate and critique, and returns a revised candidate. If the 
critique text equals No issues found. the subroutine should bypass any LLM call 
and return the original candidate unchanged. Otherwise call prompt with model 
gpt-4, temperature 0.5 and include both the original candidate and the critique 
in the prompt. Instruct the LLM to rewrite the answer fixing every listed issue 
while preserving as much correct reasoning as possible, and to output the 
result in the exact THOUGHT / ANSWER template. The revised text becomes the 
return value.
