Create a Gendo subroutine called critique_answer that accepts one string 
parameter named candidate and returns a critique string. Inside use prompt with 
model gpt-4 and temperature 0.0 asking the LLM to act as a strict logician who 
inspects the supplied candidate for logical, factual or reasoning errors. If 
the candidate is flawless the LLM must reply exactly with No issues found. 
Otherwise it must list the problems it detects in plain text sentences. The 
subroutine simply outputs whatever the LLM returns so later stages can decide 
whether refinement is required.
