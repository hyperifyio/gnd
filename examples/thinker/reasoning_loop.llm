Create a top-level Gendo routine called reasoning_loop that accepts the userâ€™s 
question string and produces a final answer string. The routine must call 
generate_candidates to obtain an array of candidates, map critique_answer 
across that array to gather critiques, iterate through the indexes 0 to 2 and 
for each position either keep the original candidate if its critique is No 
issues found. or call refine_answer to replace it with a corrected version, 
collect the resulting candidates into a new array and pass that array to 
judge_best, then output the string returned by judge_best. The routine ends by 
printing the final answer so users see only the selected, vetted ANSWER.
