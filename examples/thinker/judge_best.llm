Create a Gendo subroutine named judge_best that receives an array called 
candidates containing three candidate strings and returns the best candidate’s 
ANSWER text. Call prompt with model gpt-4 and temperature 0.0, giving the LLM 
the three numbered candidates and asking it to choose which is most correct and 
logically sound. Instruct it to respond in two lines where the first begins 
with BEST_ANSWER: followed by the full THOUGHT / ANSWER content of the chosen 
candidate and the second begins with REASON: followed by a brief justification. 
After the prompt call extract only the text after BEST_ANSWER: and return that 
as the final answer.
