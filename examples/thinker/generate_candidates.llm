Create a Gendo subroutine named generate_candidates that takes a single string 
parameter called question and returns an array of three candidate answers. 
Inside the subroutine call prompt with model gpt-4, temperature 0.7 and n set 
to 3. The prompt must instruct the LLM to think step by step, label its 
reasoning with the exact tag THOUGHT and its conclusion with the exact tag 
ANSWER, and to follow that format without any extra text. Each of the three 
completions should be collected into a list so the caller receives 
candidates[0], candidates[1] and candidates[2] as separate strings in 
THOUGHT / ANSWER format.
