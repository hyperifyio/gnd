The `debug` operation logs one or more values at the debug level and then 
returns the last value unchanged. When called with no arguments, it defaults to 
logging the current value of `_`. When provided values, it logs each argument’s 
string representation, joins them with spaces, and emits a single line to 
standard error. After logging, the last value is rebound to the specified 
destination or `_` if none is provided.

The syntax of the `debug` operation is:

  debug [destination [value1 [value2 …]]]

If no `destination` or values are given, `debug` is equivalent to:

  debug _ _

logging the current `_` value. If values are provided, you must supply a 
destination when specifying any values; otherwise, omit both to log `_`.

For example, to log the current value without rebinding a name:

  debug

If `_` holds `42`, this writes:

  42

to stderr and leaves `_` as `42`.

To log two values and bind the last one explicitly:

  debug result interimList statusFlag

If `interimList` is `["a","b"]` and `statusFlag` is `true`, this writes:

  ["a","b"] true

to stderr and then binds `true` to `result`.

Any misuse—such as providing values without a destination—results in a parse or 
runtime error.
