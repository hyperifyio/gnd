# Rule

All `TODO` comments in `pkg/bitnet/**/*.go` or markdown files must include a **GitHub issue reference** that explains which ticket will cover the deferred work.

Use the format:

```go
// TODO(#123): clarify task ownership
````

If you're about to write a TODO without a known issue, stop and:

* Use `gh issue list --label bitnet,task` to find existing issues

### [ OK ] Good

```go
// TODO(#172): add parallel execution for BitNet inference
```

```go
// TODO(#184): handle case when input is empty but context is present
```

### [FAIL] Bad

```go
// TODO: handle empty input later
```

```go
// TODO: refactor this logic eventually
```

# [NOTE] Notes

* Use `#` before the issue number to make the reference unambiguous.
* This ensures TODOs are trackable and never lost in source code.
* Cursor can call `gh` to help you search for tasks:
  `gh issue list --label bitnet,task`
* You can also grep your repo for all TODOs with `grep -r TODO pkg/bitnet`

All TODOs must eventually link to real work items. Comments without a ticket number will be flagged during review or rule checks.
