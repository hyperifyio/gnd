# BitNet Development Process Rule

This rule describes the overall development process for the BitNet project, including coding standards, workflows, and best practices for contributors.

# Development Process Guidelines

## Code Changes Process
1. **Test-First Development**
   - Write unit tests before implementation
   - Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
   - Document test cases and expected results
   - Follow TDD practices

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Run all tests in `pkg/bitnet/*`
   - Ensure 100% test coverage for new code
   - Verify existing tests still pass
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Run benchmarks for all changes
   - Check memory allocations
   - Monitor CPU usage
   - Compare against performance thresholds

4. **Code Quality**
   - Fix all linter errors
   - Address memory allocation issues
   - Optimize CPU-heavy operations
   - Document optimizations

## Git Workflow
1. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Use semantic commit messages
   - Reference related issues/PRs
   - Keep commits atomic

2. **PR Management**
   - Create draft PRs for work in progress
   - Mark PRs as ready when complete
   - Include test results in PR description
   - Link related issues

3. **Review Process**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Update tests if needed
   - Rerun benchmarks after changes
   - Keep PR up to date

## Automation
1. **Test Automation**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   go test ./pkg/bitnet/... -v
   
   # Run benchmarks
   ./scripts/run_benchmarks.sh
   
   # Check coverage
   go test ./pkg/bitnet/... -coverprofile=coverage.out
   ```

2. **Performance Checks**
   ```bash
   # Run memory profiling
   go test -bench=. -benchmem -memprofile=mem.prof ./pkg/bitnet/...
   
   # Run CPU profiling
   go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./pkg/bitnet/...
   ```
