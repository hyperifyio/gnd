# BitNet Project Overview

**Purpose:** Quickly orient contributors to the BitNet codebase and its primary objectives.

## Goals

* **Pure Go Inference Engine**: Implement Microsoft’s BitNet b1.58‑2B‑4T model using only Go.
* **CPU Optimization**: High throughput and low memory usage on multi‑core CPUs.
* **Future GPU Support**: Architect for easy GPU acceleration.

## Repository Structure

```
/                       # Root contains README, go.mod, CI configs
pkg/bitnet/             # Core implementation packages
└─ tensor/               # Tensor data structures and operations
scripts/                # Automation scripts (benchmarks, profiles)
docs/                   # Supporting documentation and design notes
examples/               # Usage examples and demos
```
