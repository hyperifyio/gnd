# BitNet Issue Management Rule

This rule defines the standards and workflow for managing issues in the BitNet project, including issue creation, triage, and resolution.

# BitNet Issue Structure and Roadmap

## Main Issue

[Issue #170](https://github.com/hyperifyio/gnd/issues/170) is the parent issue for the BitNet implementation project. It outlines the overall goal of implementing Microsoft's BitNet b1.58-2B-4T model in pure Go.

## Issue Hierarchy

- [Issue #170](https://github.com/hyperifyio/gnd/issues/170) - Pure Go LLM for CPUs (for BitNet b1.58-2B 4T model)
  - Parent issue containing the overall project roadmap
  - All implementation tasks are tracked as sub-issues

## Current Roadmap (Issues 171-192)

The current implementation roadmap consists of 22 sequential tasks:

1. [Issue #171](https://github.com/hyperifyio/gnd/issues/171) - Project Setup
   - Initialize Go module
   - Set up multi-core support
   - Basic project structure

2. [Issue #172](https://github.com/hyperifyio/gnd/issues/172) - Model Weights & Tokenizer
   - Download and integrate model files
   - Implement tokenizer

3. Issues #173-192
   - Sequential implementation tasks
   - Each issue represents a specific component or feature
   - Must be implemented in order

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Issue Dependencies:
   - Each issue builds upon previous ones
   - Must complete issues in sequence
   - No skipping of issues in the roadmap

2. Branch Creation:
   - Use `gh issue develop` for each sub-issue
   - Branch from `bitnet` base branch
   - Follow naming convention: `feat/bitnet-{issue_number}-{description}`

3. PR Process:
   - Create PRs against `bitnet` branch
   - Link to both parent issue (#170) and specific sub-issue
   - Follow review process defined in [bitnet-development.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/bitnet-development.mdc)

## Progress Tracking

1. Issue Status:
   - Track progress through GitHub issue status
   - Update parent issue (#170) with overall progress
   - Keep sub-issues updated with implementation status

2. Documentation:
   - Update [pkg/bitnet/README.md](mdc:pkg/bitnet/README.md) with implementation progress
   - Document completed features
   - Track remaining tasks

## Best Practices

1. Issue Management:
   - Always reference parent issue (#170) in PR descriptions
   - Keep issue descriptions up to date
   - Document any deviations from the roadmap

2. Implementation Order:
   - Follow the sequential order of issues
   - Complete each issue before moving to the next
   - Document any dependencies between issues

3. Communication:
   - Use issue comments for implementation discussions
   - Update parent issue with major milestones
   - Keep stakeholders informed of progress
