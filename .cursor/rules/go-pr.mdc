# Pull Request Description Update

**Purpose:** Generate a structured PR description using the project script as a template and apply it to the current Pull Request.

```bash
# Read current task number
./scripts/get-current-task-number.sh

# Read current task info
./scripts/get-current-task.sh

# Read current PR number:
./scripts/get-current-pr-number.sh

# Read current implementation file changes
./scripts/bitnet-get-current-implementation-changes.sh
``` 

## Steps

1. **Generate Template**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_pr_description_template.sh
   ```

   This outputs a Markdown template with placeholder sections (e.g., commits list, issue links, benchmarks).

2. **Populate & Edit**

   * Treat the script output as a template.
   * Replace placeholders with actual commit summaries, linked issues, and any other details.
   * Preserve any real benchmark metrics exactly.

3. **Apply to PR**

   ```bash
   gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --body "<populated-template>"
   ```

   Paste the finalized Markdown in place of `<populated-template>`.
