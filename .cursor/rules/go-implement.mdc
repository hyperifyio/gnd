# BitNet Task Prompt Guidance

**Purpose:** Generate and follow a tailored task prompt for the current BitNet 
issue using the project script to implement the feature.

## Usage

Run the helper script to output the current task prompt:

```bash
./scripts/get-bitnet-task-prompt.sh
```

The script will print step-by-step instructions related to your active BitNet issue (e.g., issue overview, goals, verification steps).

**Follow** the printed guidance precisely, executing any commands or review steps it suggests.

*No additional rules or automations: simply generate the prompt and act on it.*
