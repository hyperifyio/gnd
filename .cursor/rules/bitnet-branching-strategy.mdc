# Branching Strategy

**Purpose:** Standardize branch creation to link code to issues and maintain clarity.

## Base Branch

* All feature branches originate from `bitnet`.

## Creating a Branch

* Use GitHub CLI for consistency:

  ```bash
  gh issue develop <ISSUE_NUMBER> \
    --base bitnet \
    --name feat/bitnet-<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<short-description> \
    --checkout
  ```

## Naming Convention

* Prefix with `feat/bitnet-` for features, `fix/bitnet-` for bug fixes.
* Format: `{type}/bitnet-{issue_number}-{short-description}`

  * Example: `feat/bitnet-173-add-tokenizer`

## Listing Branches

* To list branches tied to an issue:

  ```bash
  gh issue develop --list <ISSUE_NUMBER>
  ```

## Deleting After Merge

* Once merged, delete local and remote branches:

  ```bash
  git branch -d feat/bitnet-173-add-tokenizer
  gh pr close <PR_NUMBER>
  ```
