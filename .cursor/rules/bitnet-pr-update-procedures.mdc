'# PR Update Procedures

**Purpose:** Keep PRs up-to-date with latest changes and feedback in a safe, documented manner.

## Committing Updates

* Stage changes:

  ```bash
  git add <files>
  ```
* Commit with conventional message:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "<type>(bitnet): <short description>"
  ```
* Use `--amend` only for trivial fixes before first review.

## Pushing Updates

* Push to feature branch:

  ```bash
  git push origin HEAD
  ```
* For rebased branches, force push safely:

  ```bash
  git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
  ```

## Handling Conflicts

* Pull and rebase:

  ```bash
  git pull --rebase origin bitnet
  ```
* Resolve conflicts in code, then:

  ```bash
  git add <resolved files>
  git rebase --continue
  ```
* Force push updated history:

  ```bash
  git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD
  ```

## Best Practices

* Run tests and benchmarks before push.
* Keep commits focused: one purpose per commit.
* Document why force-push was needed in the commit message or PR comment.
* Notify reviewers if significant updates occur.

## Merging After Updates

* Never merge (product manager does that)
